Getting Started

So that we all can work together follow the steps below:

fork this reposototy to your own account and switch to the forked one
now in your new "own" forked reposotory click on the green "clone or download" button and download the zip file
open git bash
in git bash: switch to the directory you have chosen for the downloaded and hopefully now unzipped project file
in git bash: git init
git remote add orinin https://github.com/YOURREPOSOTORYNAMEHERE/Spotidoodle.git
git remote add SOMENAMEOFAREPOHERE https://github.com/OxanaDoroshkevich/Spotidoodle.git
check your reposotory status with: git remote -v
this should allow you now to push to your own master and pull from the master master ;)

if you want to commit some changes, follow the following instruction:

git status
git add . (for all files that were changed) OR git add filename (for specific file)
git commit -m "SOME MESSAGE HERE"
git push origin master
I would recommend to do the pull requests to merge the local code to the master master branch. so that everything is alwas save from merging error!

Good to know. If you have some problems with git and you can't pull or push or even checkout the master again or something and you're just fucking stuck...

git reset --hard origin/master

to get the version of your accounts master branch status.
